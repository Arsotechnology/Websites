		Hello, I hope you are doing well! My name is James Karwacki and I’m currently studying Multimedia Design and Development with a concentration in Website Design and Development at DeVry University. I have been in DeVry going on three years now and expected to graduate in December, 2018. At DeVry, I have been on the Dean List 2016, 2017, and I am part of the National Society of Leadership and Success, which is a national honor society at the University. In this portfolio, I present work that I have completed at the school and also work that I have done professionally. My hope is that this portfolio represents my design and web design talents to an on looker and potential employers in a matter that is dignified. I hope one respects and appreciates the hard work that is behind all the pieces in this portfolio.<br><br> 

        I would like to take this time to thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio. I hope that it meets your expectations. Enjoy!

My choice was to design a site for a local Bed and Breakfast in the small town that I live in. This was my first website design project using HTML5 and CSS3, so learning the syntax to the two program languages was critical to complete the project. Upon doing so, I designed fully functioning four-page website with a logo.</p>

I created this logo following the theme they wanted which was one Magnolia Tree. The owners very much appreciated the upgrade to their website and an addition of a new logo. </p> </div>
