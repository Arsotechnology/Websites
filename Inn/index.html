	                <h2>History of Property</h2>
		                <p>
                           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important person to inhabit the house at
                            14 North Aurora St.was the Rev. Henry Lay. The Rev. Lay was the first bishop of
                            the diocese of Easton. He bought the land and premises from Robert Lloyd Tilghman
                            and his sister Augusta. Mrs. Tilghman inherited the property from her mother. No
                            doubt the Bishop added to the original structure. The Nickerson family next owned
                            the house until John McDaniel bought it. While this family lived on the premises
                            less than ten years, their name has been strongly identified with the house. In
                            1943 Anne Hyde Ingraham bought the property. She was the widow of Prentiss Ingraham,
                            whose father wrote “The Land of Legendary Lore”, a delightful tale of Countyin the
                            earlier days. This fine old Victorian house is now in use as one of Easton’s charming
                            Bed and Breakfast&#39;s.
                        </p>

                            Aurora St. Easton, MD. This lovely Victorian home was built in 1865 and has been
                            the home of many prominent Maryland families.
